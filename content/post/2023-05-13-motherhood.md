When I was 12 years old, I had an epiphany. I knew I wanted to raise a daughter, just like momma was raising me. That 12 year old me knew it in her bones. It was so clearly obvious to her that one day she was going to be a mother to a daughter. Boys were very silly, so why marry? I was going to adopt! I told momma and she was so proud of me. She had high praise for my idea. The thought was so pure and simple, yet so profound.

When I reflect on this today, as I hold my precious little one, I feel very warm and fuzzy inside. I feel my whole life has culminated into this. It's as if all the pieces have come together to form this beautiful, perfect moment.

I have daydreamed some big dreams, but never really dreamt of being a mom. Never dreamt of doing those mommy things - picking up your kid from school and driving them to a swim/chess/drama class. During campus placements, when Ravi was asked “where do you see yourself in 10 years” in one of his job interviews, he nonchalantly answered “I see myself riding a bike and my kid trailing on his own bike behind mine”. I never really had these thoughts, expect that one epiphany of the 12 year old me.

I am a mother now. And oh my, I cannot tell you how right this feels. It has never felt more right. It’s perfect actually. Can it get any better? This feeling of being fulfilled, contented, satisfied.

And so I’ve embraced this new role with a heart full of love and hope and wonder. The journey ahead may be challenging at times, but I am ready and there's nothing that I cannot do. Motherhood is my calling, and I am blessed beyond measure to have answered it.

Wishing all mothers a very happy mother's day!
