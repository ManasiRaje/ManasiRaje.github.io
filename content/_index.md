I am a Senior Software Engineer at Roku, where I lead Vector Search in the search org. My primary interest lies in brigning novel machine learning techniques to the search and recommendations domain. Before Roku, I worked as a Machine Learning engineer at Adobe, on the search team.

I live in San Francisco with my daughter, husband, and dog.
