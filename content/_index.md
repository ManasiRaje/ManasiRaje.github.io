I am a Senior Software Engineer at Roku, where I lead Vector Search in the Search team. My primary interest lies in bringing novel AI techniques to the Search and Recommendations domain. Before Roku, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Adobe, on the Search team.

I live in San Francisco with my daughter, husband, and dog.
